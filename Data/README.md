# Data README

## Raw Data
Here is where you should store all of the raw data so that it can be used by the other functions and files in this repository.
The raw data may be found on Box at 

https://byu.app.box.com/folder/103939543408

## Processed Data
The raw data was processed in process.m (DataProcessing/process.m) and resulted
in a .mat file titled "ProcessedResultsFeb2020.mat". Due to size restrictions on Github,
this .mat file has also been stored on Box. Note that the ProcessedResultsFeb2020.mat
file is the primary data file used in almost every script.

(Note that there is an old version of the ProcessedResults .mat on Box as well.
That version does not use the center 42 carriers, but rather the 42 that were
determined to be best. It will likely get removed from Box soon, but until then...)
