# Reference Signals
These reference signals were gathered as a way to account for the effects 
from each individual radio. 
Ideally, these would be gathered immediately after data is gathered, without 
making any adjustments to the setup or code, to generate a more accurate reference
signal as it changes a bit from time to time.

These particular reference signals were gathered at an earlier time in the office
as we forgot to gather them at the MARB.
