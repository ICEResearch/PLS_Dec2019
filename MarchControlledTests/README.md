MARCH CONTROLLED TESTS:

    Purpose: Determine how objects blocking line-of-sight at different proximities
                to the Tx/Rx affects capacity

    Location: Parking lot West of the LaVell Edwards Stadium 

    Procedure:
    - We set up a Tx in an empty parking lot, connected to an amplifier
    - We set up 4 Rx ~32 feet away in an arc, and marked every 8 feet along
        the Tx/Rx path 
    - We started by covering the Tx antenna as thoroughly as we could for about
        ten seconds, and then had one person walk across the Tx/Rx path for each
        radio at 5 different levels (0' (0%), 8' (25%), 16' (50%), 24' (75%),
        and 32' (100%)), with distance in terms of feet from Tx
            (Data was gathered using 'MarbRx_Feb2020.m' & 'MarchControlled_video.py')
    - We then repeated the previous step, but with a group of four instead of just
        one person creating blockage
    - We repeated it a second time, this time using a car to create blockage,
        rather than people

        (Note that one of the 4 laptops ran out of battery befoer the car test
         was completed, so there are not 4 versions of that test).

    Processing:
        (IN PROGRESS - will likely plot LOS vs time over Capacity vs time)

    Data:
    - Three different files were created per laptop for each experiment. 
        - .mat file: Matlab-generated file containing an array with both received
                signal and timestamps 
        - .avi file: Generated by the python file, this contained video
        - .txt file: Generated by the python file, this saved a timestamp
                        corresponding to each video frame
    - Data can be found on Box at https://byu.app.box.com/folder/109189208163

    Other:
    - MarchControlled_rx.m ran a quick function to take in a signal, process it,
        and plot the capacity in real time as a way for us to see what was going on
